# Contributing Guide

First of all, **Welcome!** :wave: and thank you for your interest in contributing to our UI testing framework.

## Feedback

### Issues

Have you a **question**? Have you found a **problem** ðŸš« you would like to see fixed? Is there something you would like to see improved or **features** ðŸš€ added?

Then we'd like to hear from you. Hop on to the [issue tracker](../../issues) and create an issue. If you would **check if a similar issue already exists** beforehand, it would be much appreciated :heart:.

If you happen to find an **existing issue or a pull request** that interests you, feel free to **comment** or upvote :+1: / downvote :-1: to give us your opinion (**we do prefer comments over votes**).

## Code, Building, Testing and Pull Requests

If submitting issues just doesn't cut it for you, we are always happy to see code contributions. Here are a few steps to get your code in as fast as possible:

### Get the Code

The first step is to fork this repository and clone your new fork. We also recommend adding the upstream as a new remote so you can easily get updates.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your user name>/vscode-extension-tester
cd vscode-extension-tester
git remote add upstream https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-extension-tester
```

### Build It

Now that you have the code, you will need to build the project. First, we need to install all modules dependencies:

```nodejs
npm install
```

### Test It

**When you make a change, make sure the tests are passing**. In the `tests/test-project` directory there is a dummy VS Code extension we use to test the framework itself.

For that, you can use the following script and launch the tests:

```nodejs
npm run test:build
```

If you are adding a new feature, be sure to **write new tests** for it. If you navigate to the `tests/test-project/src/test` folder, you will find a test file structure that mirrors the source files. Put your new test into the appropriate existing file, or create a new one that follows the same structure.

### Pull Requests

Having made and tested your changes, we recommend committing them into a new branch:

```shell
git checkout -b <my-new-branch>
git add <changed files>
git commit -m <type>(optional scope): <description> # see https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary
git push origin <my-new-branch>
```

Now the changes are in a new branch in your fork, you can submit a new pull request. **If your pull request is intended to fix an issue in the tracker, make sure to link the two together**.

Lastly, a pull request check on [Github Actions](../../actions) is going to kick in whenever a change is pushed. **Please make sure it ends up green**. Otherwise it might need a change on your part. Or maybe it also needs a change on our part - in that case opening a [new issue](../../issues) is the best way to go.
